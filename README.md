# Binary Game

Built from scratch using only:
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- Vanilla Javascript

## Purpose of the game

This simple game serves as an interactive simulation of a binary search.

**NOTE**: The game is created during my Web Development training at @itbootcampphp. About 90% of the JS file is written during the two-hour test. Styles and additional features were added later.
