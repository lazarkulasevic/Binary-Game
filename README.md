# Binary Game

Built from scratch using only:
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- Vanilla Javascript

## [PLAY NOW :video_game:](https://lazarkulasevic.github.io/binary-game)

The game uses player's **local storage** to save *overall accuracy* which is calculated as the number of won games divided by the total number of plays. The result is printed in the footer area.

## The purpose of the game

This simple game serves as an interactive simulation of a binary search.

**NOTE**: The game is created during my Web Development training at @itbootcampphp. About 90% of the JS file is written during the two-hour test. Styles and additional features were added later.
